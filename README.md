# Web-Scraping-NBA-players
A simple scrape of the nba website to gather all the current player names and other details. Done using Python and BeautifulSoup with PhantomJS as the driver using Selenium.

The player list on the NBA website was infinitely scrolling, so I had to write a function to scroll to the end of the page and then start the scraping.
