# NBA.com-webscraping
A simple scrape of the nba website to gather all the current player names and other details. Done using Python and BeautifulSoup with PhantomJS/Selenium as the driver

The player list on the NBA website was infinitely scrolling, so we first scroll all the way to the end of the page and then start scraping.
