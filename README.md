# Web-Scraping-NBA-players
A simple scrape of the nba website to gather all the current player names and other details. Done using Python and BeautifulSoup with PhantomJS/Selenium as the driver

The player list on the NBA website was infinitely scrolling, so I had to write a function to scroll to the end of the page and then start the scraping.
